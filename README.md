I am the official maintainer of FreeLarn.

<b>Master Branch</b></br>
This master branch is also Apache 2.0 Licensed.  The code of Larn has now been converted to C++17 and the vast 
majority of bugs have been squashed.

# Build Status #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atsb/RL_M.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atsb/RL_M)

# Compiling from Source #
Compiling Larn from source will require a C++17 compiler as a minimum plus ncurses/pdcurses.  See the 'build' folder for makefiles.
