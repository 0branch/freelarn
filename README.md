I am the official maintainer of FreeLarn.

# Build Status #
//coming

# Compiling from Source #
Compiling Larn from source will require a C++11 compiler as a minimum plus ncurses/pdcurses.  See the 'build' folder for makefiles.

# History #
FreeLarn is a direct descendent of the original Larn, that has been mostly (approx 91%) rewritten into C++11 with many additions and features that many now consider a variant.

Initially Development stopped in March 2018 due to the negativity expressed by some people about my changes.  I genuinely missed working on it and enjoy playing it, so I picked it back up.
