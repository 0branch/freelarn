I am the official maintainer of FreeLarn.

# Build Status #
//coming

# Compiling from Source #
Compiling Larn from source will require a C++17 compiler as a minimum plus ncurses/pdcurses.  See the 'build' folder for makefiles.

# History #
FreeLarn is a direct descendent of the original Larn, that has been mostly (approx 91%) rewritten into C++17 with many additions and features that many now consider a variant.

# Contributing # 
Feel free to raise Issues or PR's if you have something to add/fix.
